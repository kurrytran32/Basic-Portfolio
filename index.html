        <p>Hi, my name is Kerry Tran.  This is a basic portfolio made while attending UCSD Coding Boot Camp.  My favorite animals are Tigers, Wolves, and Sharks.  I love to play video games.  One of my favorite games is Counter Strike Global Offensive.  Some of my favorite foods include, burgers, pizza, and sandwiches.</p>
    
        <p>In finishing this course, I would like to be able to create something, webpage, program that inspires others to also create.  The self satisfaction of seeing people appreciate a product you made is motivating.  In the future, I would like to make a nonprofit website that links to different nonprofit organizations that need donations or help.</p>
